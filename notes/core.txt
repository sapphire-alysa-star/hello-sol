Core Data Types:
Pubkey — The address of a Solana account. Some account addresses are ed25519 public keys, with corresponding secret keys that are managed off-chain. Often, though, account addresses do not have corresponding secret keys — as with program derived addresses — or the secret key is not relevant to the operation of a program, and may have even been disposed of. As running Solana programs can not safely create or manage secret keys, the full Keypair is not defined in solana-program but in solana-sdk.
Hash — A cryptographic hash. Used to uniquely identify blocks, and also for general purpose hashing.
AccountInfo — A description of a single Solana account. All accounts that might be accessed by a program invocation are provided to the program entrypoint as AccountInfo.
Instruction — A directive telling the runtime to execute a program, passing it a set of accounts and program-specific data.
ProgramError and ProgramResult — The error type that all programs must return, reported to the runtime as a u64.
Sol — The Solana native token type, with conversions to and from lamports, the smallest fractional unit of SOL, in the native_token module.
