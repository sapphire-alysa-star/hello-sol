Retardedly Solana instructions cannot by default return anything to caller. Thats stupid but ok. They can log stuff.

https://docs.solanalabs.com/proposals/return-data


The existing solution that Solang uses, writes the return data to the callee account data.
 The caller's account cannot be used, since the callee may not be the same SBF program, so it will not have permission to write to the callee's account data.

Another solution would be to have a single return data account which is passed around through CPI.
Again this does not work for CPI as the callee may not have permission to write to it.

The problem with this solution is:

It does not work for RPC calls
It is very racey; a client has to submit the Tx and then retrieve the account data. This is not atomic so the return data can be overwritten by another transaction.


use solana_program::msg;

// The fast form
msg!("verifying multisig");

// With formatting
let err = "not enough signers";
msg!("multisig failed: {}", err);

Note that Rustâ€™s formatting machinery is relatively CPU-intensive for constrained environments like the Solana VM.
