Suff you can do in Solana:
-- Get the current timestamp
-- Note: Each validator reports their UTC time to the ledger on a regular interval by intermittently adding a timestamp to a Vote for a particular block. 
A requested block's time is calculated from the stake-weighted mean of the Vote timestamps in a set of recent blocks recorded on the ledger.
-- Time function doesnt work well on local host

Documented:
-- Get the current unix timestamp (may not be precise)

Partial:
-- Return values (toDo: how big is this buffer really)
-- You can read from the return data log in a CPI

Definitely Can Do:
-- Send Solana
-- Send SPL tokens
-- Make a CPI

Other:
-- Make a new PDA
-- Close PDAs and other owned accounts
-- 


Need to grok in vanilla solana:
-- Zero Copy
-- Writeup on compute budgets and what costs what
