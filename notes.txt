Suff you can do in Solana:
-- Get the current timestamp
-- Note: Each validator reports their UTC time to the ledger on a regular interval by intermittently adding a timestamp to a Vote for a particular block. 
A requested block's time is calculated from the stake-weighted mean of the Vote timestamps in a set of recent blocks recorded on the ledger.
-- Time function doesnt work well on local host
